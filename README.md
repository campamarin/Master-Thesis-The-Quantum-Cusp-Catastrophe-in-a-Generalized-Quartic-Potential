# Quantum Cusp Catastrophe â€“ Sample Notebook

This repository contains a simplified Jupyter notebook showcasing a portion of the code developed for my Master's thesis project on the **Quantum Cusp Catastrophe**. The notebook includes sample code snippets and parameters that illustrate the core ideas and methods explored during the larger research effort.

## Purpose

The notebook is not intended to be a full reproduction of the thesis work, but rather a minimal and quite messy demonstration of the key functions and concepts and plots represented in the thesis. It serves as an example for:

- Evaluating how certain parameters affect the system
- Exploring basic visualizations and calculations
- Providing a glimpse into the numerical implementation used in the study

## About the Thesis

The project focused on quantum analogs of classical catastrophe theory, particularly the **cusp catastrophe**, and explored how quantum states behave near critical points. This involved theoretical modeling, numerical simulations, and an analysis of quantum phase transitions.
